    <h2>Tips</h2>

    <p>Taste a little of the filling to ensure that the right amount of chocolaty goodness has been reached. You can add a little more of the cocoa powder and water mixture to taste.  

        Instead of freezing, the cheesecake can also be covered and chilled at least 2 hours before serving.
        
        Cheesecake may be stored in an airtight container and chilled up to 5 days.
